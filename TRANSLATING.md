# Translating the Sandboxie project

Sandboxie caters to a diverse user base, from individual users to large corporations. As the software's popularity grows, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that users can access it in their preferred language. Therefore, providing localization options for Sandboxie is not just a thoughtful gesture, but also a necessary step to enhance user experience.

To achieve this goal, Sandboxie has established a translation program that enables users to volunteer their language skills to translate the software's user interface and documentation.
